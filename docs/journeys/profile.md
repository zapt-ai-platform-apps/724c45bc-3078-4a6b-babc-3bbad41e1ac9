# Profile Page Journey

1. Click on "Profile" in the top navigation bar.
2. You will see an input field to enter your name.
3. Type your name (or any value) and then click "Save".
4. A simple alert will show that your profile name has been saved (simulated in the front end).
5. Any errors will be reported to Sentry.

The profile page is where you can capture user data. In a production scenario, you'd connect this to a backend or authentication system.
