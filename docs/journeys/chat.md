# Chat Page Journey

1. Click on "Chat" in the top navigation bar.
2. In the Chat section, you can type a message into the text area.
3. Click the "Send" button to simulate sending the message.
4. A simple alert will confirm the message was "sent" (local demonstration).
5. Any errors (e.g., network issues or server errors in a real environment) are also captured by Sentry.

This journey is a placeholder for a real-time or asynchronous chat feature, which would require actual backend integration or websockets.
